## Question 1
In my opinion it is a better idea to migrate the lab into Ubuntu instead of upgrading to new computers. There are many benefits of using Ubuntu. Some of the benefits of Ubuntu are: it is free to use and can be installed on any computer, Ubuntu is fully customizable and easy to modify, also Ubuntu's command line is easy to use and more secure, plus  Ubuntu is open source.
By switching to Ubuntu they should be able to browse the Internet, edit, teach, and run many applications and programs without any issues. So moving to Ubuntu is much better than buying new computers and Windows10 licenses.

## Question 10
1. For me, the hardest question was number4. Because, part 3 and 4 was hard to solve.
2. The easiest question is Number10. Because, it is a survey and it is only asking me to provide some feedbacks on the midterm.
3. I would say, if each question had less steps it would have been easier.
4. It will be 5. I have learned a lot about linux.
5. I think its easier to take traditional exams, because they are multiple choices. In my opinion, traditional exam is better than this because they're easy to take.
