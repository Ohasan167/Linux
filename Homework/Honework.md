## What are the basic freedoms that make a software open source?
"Free software" means software which respects the freedom and community of users. Generally speaking, this means that users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, modify, and improve the software. Therefore, "free software" is about freedom, not price. To understand the concept, you have to think of "freedom" as "free speech" and not "free beer". Sometimes we call it "free software", borrowing the French or Spanish word for "free" as in freedom, to show that we don't mean that software is free.
## Why do you think people should use the free software/open-source alternative instead of the proprietary version?
The reason people should use free software is to,

* The freedom to implement the software for any use case without restrictions. For example, saying that a program's license expires after 30 days makes it non-free.
* The freedom to study how the software works and modify it to suit your needs and preferences.
* The freedom to freely redistribute software to help someone in need. Redistribution can be done free of charge or at no cost.
* The freedom to improve software performance and publish your improvements for the benefit of the community, programmers and non-programmers. You can do this for free or at no cost.
## Watch the following video: Why is free software important? Richard Stallman - in INT's ENLIGHTENMENT MINUTES. Do you agree with Richard Stallman? Do you disagree? Explain your answer.
I agree with Richard Stallman. Using free software means making a political and ethical decision affirming the right to learn and to share what we learn with others. Free software has become the foundation of a learning society in which we share our knowledge so that others can benefit and benefit from it.
